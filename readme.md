# PDF Interpreter Project

This project is a Python-based tool designed to extract text from PDF files, process the content using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and answer questions related to the text. The tool provides a simple interface for users to upload a PDF, ask questions about its content, and receive answers.

## Features
PDF Text Extraction: Extract text from PDF files using the PyMuPDF library.
Natural Language Processing: Process and understand text using NLP techniques, including text summarization and question answering.
Interactive User Interface: A simple interface (using Streamlit) for users to interact with the PDF content and ask questions.
Modular Design: The project is structured with modular components for easy maintenance and extension.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* pip (Python package installer)
### Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf_interpreter_project.git
    cd pdf_interpreter_project
2. Create a Virtual Environment:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Application:
    python main.py

## Usage
### Running the Application
1. Start the Application:

Run the main.py file to launch the user interface. The application allows you to upload a PDF file, extract its content, and ask questions about the text.

2. Upload a PDF:

Use the file uploader in the UI to select a PDF file. The text will be extracted and displayed.

3. Ask a Question:

Type a question related to the text in the input box and click the "Answer" button. The application will provide an answer based on the extracted content.

### Example
Here’s how you can interact with the tool:

1. Upload a PDF file (e.g., data/example.pdf).
2. Enter a question like "What is the main concept discussed in the introduction?"
3. The tool will process the question and display the relevant answer.

## Testing
To run the tests, ensure you have pytest installed, and then execute the following command:
    pytest tests/

This will run the unit tests to ensure all modules are functioning correctly.

## Dependencies
* PyMuPDF (fitz): For PDF text extraction.
* spaCy: For Natural Language Processing.
* Hugging Face Transformers: For question-answering models.
* Streamlit: For the user interface.
You can find all the required dependencies in the requirements.txt file.
